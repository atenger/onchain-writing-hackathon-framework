# Planning the Hackathon

## Define the Purpose
Clearly define what you want to achieve with the hackathon. This could be to promote onchain writing, encourage creativity, or build community.

As an example, for the Farcaster Writing Hackathon held in June 2024, the purpose was defined as:
- The purpose of the writing hackathon is to create and contribute to the Farcaster canon, solve current challenges within the community, and help create Farcaster's future.
 

## Set the Dates
Choosing the right timeline is crucial for a successful writing hackathon. 

In a typical hackathon, participants are expected to complete coding by the end of the event and present a demo. However, in a writing hackathon, the actual event often serves best for brainstorming and community building. Many participants may prefer to take additional time alone to edit and finalize their submissions.

### Recommendation:
- Consider organizing an in-person or virtual community component that lasts between 8 to 24 hours. During this time, participants can collaborate, brainstorm, and ideally complete a draft or outline of their work.
- After this initial event, give participants a few more days or even up to a week to refine, edit, and finalize their submissions before the final deadline.



## Platform Selection
Choosing the right platform is essential for facilitating both the in-person and virtual components of your hackathon.

### In-Person Venue
- **Physical Space**: If you're including an in-person component, securing a venue with meeting rooms, whiteboards, and collaborative spaces can greatly enhance the experience. Consider reaching out to local businesses, coworking spaces, or venture capital firms to see if they would be willing to donate or sponsor the space for your event. 
- **Example**: For the Farcaster Writing Hackathon, we were able to secure office space donated by a VC firm, which provided a professional and creative environment for participants to brainstorm and collaborate.

### Virtual Platform
- **Gather.town**: For the virtual component, consider using platforms like [Gather.town](https://gather.town/), which allows participants to interact in a virtual space designed to mimic real-world environments. This can help maintain a sense of community and collaboration, even when participants are remote.
- **Other Options**: Depending on the needs of your event, you might also explore other virtual event platforms like Zoom, Discord, or Microsoft Teams, which can support various activities such as brainstorming sessions, workshops, and presentations.

### Social Media for Communication
- **Promotion and Updates**: Social media platforms like Farcaster, Twitter, or LinkedIn should be used to promote the hackathon, share updates, and engage with your audience before, during, and after the event. However, they are not typically used to host the hackathon itself.
- **Dedicated Channels**: Consider setting up dedicated channels or hashtags on social media to streamline communication and keep participants engaged.



## About Mentors and Judges

### No Formal Judging: A Focus on the Creative Process
For the hackathon we organized, we purposefully chose not to include formal judging or contests. Our focus was on fostering creativity and community, with the belief that the process of writing was more important than the outcome.

- **Intrinsic Rewards**: Participants were encouraged to find rewards in the act of creation, collaboration, and contributing to the community. 
- **Attracting the Right Participants**: By removing the competitive aspect, we aimed to attract participants who were genuinely passionate about the process of writing and contributing to the broader goals of the hackathon.
- **Publishing and Friendships**: The true prizes are getting to publish your work and make meaningful connections with others in the community.

### Optional: Including Judges and Prizes
While our hackathon focused on intrinsic rewards, we recognize that some hackathons, especially those with a specific corporate sponsor or goal, might benefit from a more structured incentive system.

- **When to Include Prizes**: If your hackathon has a defined outcome—such as creating website copy for a company or developing technical documentation—you may consider offering prizes to incentivize participation. This can be effective when the goal is to produce something specific and tangible.
- **Selecting Judges**: If you choose to include a judging component, carefully select mentors and judges who are not only experts in the relevant field but also align with the goals and values of the hackathon. Their role should be to provide constructive feedback and support rather than purely evaluating submissions.
- **Consider the Impact**: Keep in mind that introducing prizes and judging can shift the focus from creative exploration to competition. This isn’t necessarily negative, but it’s important to be clear about the hackathon’s goals from the outset.



## Budget and Resources
Plan for any costs, such as food, physical space, prizes or platform fees. Identify the resources you'll need, including any technical setup or promotional materials.

## Registration Process
Outline how participants will register. Will you use a Google Form, a dedicated platform, or something else? Ensure the process is straightforward and collects all necessary information.
