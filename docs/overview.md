# What is a Writing Hackathon?

A writing hackathon is an event where participants are challenged to create written content within a set timeframe, often focusing on a specific theme or prompt. Unlike traditional hackathons that focus on coding or technology development, writing hackathons emphasize creativity, storytelling, and collaboration.

## Purpose of a Writing Hackathon
- **Encourage Creativity**: Provide a structured environment that motivates participants to explore their creativity.
- **Foster Community**: Bring together writers, creators, and enthusiasts to collaborate, share ideas, and support each other.
- **Explore New Ideas**: Use prompts or themes to inspire new perspectives and ideas, potentially leading to innovative content.

## Structure of a Writing Hackathon
- **Theme or Prompt**: A central theme or series of prompts guide the content creation.
- **Timeframe**: Participants are given a specific amount of time (e.g., 24 hours, a week) to create their submissions.
- **Submissions**: At the end of the event, participants submit their work
